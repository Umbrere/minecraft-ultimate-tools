# Minecraft UltimateTools
This is the source code of a small abandoned project. I am kind of ashamed due to the way it is written(seems like I improved over the last 8 years). Be aware that parts of the code (especially names) are in German, sorry about that. I wasnâ€™t going to release this but was asked to. So here it is.

A few notes:
- this is the code for version 1-12-1-0 for Minecraft 1.7.2 using forge 10.12.0.1034
- feel free to fork, update and extend
- please remember to remove links to me as maintainer, i.e. the mail address in the mcmod or the link to the version control
- Please keep a reference to this git and me(Umbrere) in your release
- I would love to hear if someone is using this!
- enjoy!
